# Loop

**Loop** is a web app that helps communities **share, save, and connect** by renting everyday items locally instead of buying new. Think of it as the Airbnb for tools, gear, and even local services!

✅ Filter by category and price  
✅ Post your own items for others to rent  
✅ Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

✅ Modern, cartoony UI for a friendly, community feel

## 💡 Inspiration

- Over **$7,000 worth of unused items** sits idle in the average American household (Neighbor.com).
- The global sharing economy is projected to reach **$800 billion by 2031**.
- Americans produce **292 million tons of waste** each year, much of it from underused goods.

Loop helps reduce waste, save money, and build stronger local connections.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
